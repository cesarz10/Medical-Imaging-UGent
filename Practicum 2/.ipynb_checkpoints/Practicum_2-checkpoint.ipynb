    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise session is to obtain insight in the different steps involved in the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. We will use MC techniques to simulate a PET acquisition, instead of using analytical forward projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Positron emission tomography\n",
    "\n",
    "A positron emission tomography (PET) scanner measures the distribution of a tracer, labeled with a radioactive isotope, in the body of a patient. Since the tracer is subject to a certain metabolism in the patient, 3D physiological information can be obtained with a PET scanner. The technique is thus complementary to a CT scan, which images only anatomy.\n",
    "\n",
    "PET makes use of positron emitting radiotracers. When a positron emission occurs, the positron is quickly annihilated with a nearby electron, emitting two 511 keV gamma photons in random but opposite (back-to-back) directions. These gamma photons can be detected by the PET scanner, and when two of these detections happen within a certain coincidence time window, both are assigned to the same annihilation event. A line-of-response (LOR) can then be drawn between the two detection positions, for which is known that the annihilation took place somewhere along that line. By drawing multiple of these LORs, we can obtain a sinogram that can then be reconstructed back into image space by making use of tomographic techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Monte Carlo simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are widely used in physics and mathematics when the analytical calculation of a result is too difficult or sometimes even impossible to compute. The method is named after the Monte Carlo Casino, because it relies on repeated **random sampling** or educated guesses to compute a numerical result. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simulating a (simplified) PET acquisition can be done in the following 3 main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sampling of the source position\n",
    "- Sampling of the emission angle\n",
    "- Obtaining the intersections (if any) between the LOR and the scanner\n",
    "- Generating the sinogram from the detected LORs\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercises, you will implement these steps yourself."

    "## Exercise 1: Sampling of the source position\n",
    "\n",
    "The first random number we will use in our PET simulator will be used to pick a random point of photon emission, given a certain (3D) activity map. Here we will randomly select one voxel, taking into account its activity. A higher activity means more photons should originate from that location. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do so, we should first build the 1D probability density function (PDF) from the activity map. This is done by flattening the activity map into a 1D array, where each index *i* ∈ [0, N-1] represents a voxel (*ix, iy, iz*) in the activity map (N = # voxels). The PDF should be normalized to 1 so that the probability of emission in voxel *i* is equal to its value PDF( *i* ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling of the PDF is achieved by using the cumulative probability density (CPD), which is obtained by integrating the PDF. In the case of a discrete system, we have:\n",
    "$$CPD(i) = \\sum_{k=1}^{i}{PDF(k)}$$\n",
    "If the PDF was properly normalized, we should obtain CPD(N)=1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now select a random number *r* between 0 and 1, and relate this number to a voxel by scaling it back to the index using the CPD, see figure 1. We can then convert this linear index *i* back into a 3D index (*ix, iy, iz*). Finally, we convert this voxel index (*ix, iy, iz*) into a spatial coordinate (*x, y, z*) by an optional translation and uniform sampling within the voxel boundaries.\n",
